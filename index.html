            <p>Tartuffe’s boldness stood out to me as very original.
                Unlike all of the characters that we have seen so far,
                his brazen attitude stands out strikingly. For instance,
                in his interaction with Mariane’s maid, Dorine, he tells
                her to “cover that bosom, which I can’t bear to see.
                Such objects hurt the soul, and usher in sinful thoughts”
                (Act III Scene III). By giving a physical handkerchief,
                he out-right shows to her that he has no regard for how
                she sees him or in keeping a reserved mannerism. However,
                Tartuffe as a general character does remind me slightly
                of Don Sanche from The Cid. First, they both pine for
                someone who is already in love with someone else, be it
                Elmire (and eventually attempted to be set up with
                Mariane), or Ximena. Even though it is unlikely to follow
                through, they persevere. Further, they both have an almost
                unearned confidence. Despite not garnering support from
                many people, they are determined to earn the heart of
                those they love and continuing to fight for a legacy and
                themselves regardless of their backing.</p>

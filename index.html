            <p>We are a club at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) dedicated to French/Francophone culture. We have no membership costs or requirements.
              There is no knowledge of French language required.</p>
<br>
            <p>We host two events a month during the semester. One of those events is always off-campus and the other is on-campus.
              On-campus events include, but are not limited to, film screenings, holiday parties, and <strong>LOTS OF FOOD!</strong><br>
             <br> Off-campus events are typically hosted by a third party for a discounted price.
              These events have included French operas, concerts, restaurant visits, and book signings.</p>
